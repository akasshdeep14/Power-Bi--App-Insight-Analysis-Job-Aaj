## PowerBI_App-Insight-Analysis

Project Summary
I developed two comprehensive analytical dashboards to evaluate the Google Play Store ecosystem, focusing on app performance, user engagement, and market trends. I transformed raw data into actionable insights to understand how factors like category, rating, and pricing impact an app's success.

What I Did


Market Distribution & Monetization: I analyzed the split between free and paid apps, discovering that approximately 92.61% of the market consists of free apps.

Audience Segmentation: I categorized apps by content rating and found that the "Everyone" segment is the largest, containing over 8.7k apps.

Installation Analysis: I mapped out the total installs by category, identifying "Game" and "Communication" as the highest-volume sectors with over 30 billion installs each.

Performance Benchmarking: I identified the top-rated apps, such as ROBLOX and Duolingo, and analyzed the relationship between average ratings and installation volume.

Temporal Trend Tracking: I visualized the App Update Trend, which revealed a significant surge in app development and maintenance activity peaking in 2018.

Genre Comparison: I evaluated 33 different categories to find that genres like "Tools" and "Entertainment" maintain high average ratings despite high competition.

Tools I Used
Tableau: I utilized Tableau to create the first dashboard, leveraging its ability to bin numeric data (like installs) and create time-series line charts for update trends.

Power BI: I built the second dashboard in Power BI, using interactive slicers for content ratings and price types, as well as donut charts for percentage breakdowns.

This Google Play Store analysis reinforces proven patterns where ratings, reviews, size, pricing, and categories shape app success beyond raw popularity. It aligns closely with the initial case study and dashboard project in this conversation, emphasizing quality-driven growth in competitive markets.

Core Success Factors -

High ratings and review volume boost installs, while optimized size (under 50MB) and free/freemium models drive adoption; paid apps earn better ratings via perceived value. Regular updates sustain performance, decoupling popularity from quality.
​

Category Performance - 

Productivity, Education, and Health apps lead in ratings due to user trust; Games excel in installs but show rating volatility from competition. Focus differentiation here for balanced growth.

Strategic Implications - 

Prioritize usability, small sizes, and maintenance for visibility; blend free models with premium upsells. These data-driven tactics mirror earlier insights, enabling targeted development and monetization.
